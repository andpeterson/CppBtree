# CppBtree
This program is a basic implementation of a B-Tree to be used for sorting data

## How to run this program:
1. Create an empty file, it can be named whatever you like
2. Fill the file with numbers, they can be up to 9 digits long (negative numbers not supported as of yet as the parse isn't that advanced as of this writing) an example is provided as the data.txt file
3. Click and drag the data file into the exe file
4. The program will then sort the data into a BTree and output the results
5. Once the program is done it will await for a keypress to close
